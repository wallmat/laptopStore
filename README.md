# laptopStore
A fake laptop store made with node.js. You can select a laptop and view the data about it as well as go back to the list.

## Background
As I continue to grow professionally, I am always trying to learn new things. This was a class project. 

## How To
You will need to install Node.js latest LTS version should be fine (mine was 10.15.1).<br />
Open a terminal to the project folder and type nodemon to start a Node.js server.<br />
Then just navigate to your local http://127.0.0.1:1337 ip address in a browser.<br />

## What I learned / am Learning
* Some basics of Node.js
* Using template html pages
* How to create a basic server and start the listing process
* read files async and blocking
* Basic handing of requests/routing
* Updating DOM element values
